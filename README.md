# sciitdevops

## Project Overview
This repository serves as the base for the DevOps training program. It is designed to help participants advance towards the final goal of deploying a web site/app using all the tooling and practices covered in the DevOps training.

## How to Use This Repository

### Branching Strategy
- Each participant is encouraged to create their own branch from the main branch.
- Use your branch to work on exercises, projects, and any custom implementations related to the training.
- Regularly merge changes from the main branch to keep your branch up to date.

### Repository Structure
- The repository will contain specific folders for different exercises and projects.
- **Terraform Code:** Store Terraform scripts for managing AWS and Azure resources in the `terraform/` directory.
- **CI/CD Configuration:** Store Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or other CI/CD configuration files in the `ci-cd/` directory.
- **Application Code:** Store the web application code in the `app/` directory.
- **Documentation:** Use the `docs/` directory for any additional documentation or notes.
